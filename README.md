# @luisrojas/mediaplayer

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After, doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install @luisrojas/mediaplayer
```

# Usage

```bash
 @luisrojas/mediaplayer
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [@luisrojas/mediaplayer](https://github.com/Lanzarot98/professional-course-js)
